## Overview

A quick reference guide which shows the basic tags used in HTML. Also includes 
a table at the bottom for commonly used attributes. Developed as part of a 
Codecademy assignment, but will be useful for future projects. Tables included
cover the following HTML elements:
+ Basics
+ Formatting (basic - does not include inline CSS)
+ Lists
+ Tables
+ Other Elements (links, videos, images, audio, etc)
+ Useful Attributes

Potential areas to expand include:
